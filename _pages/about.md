Hi! I'm a student at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/) majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Economics. 

I enjoy working on computational cognitive modeling and reinforcement learning problems, and have research interests in deep learning. This coming spring, I'll be interning at Apple AI Research as part of the [Turi team](https://turi.com/) under the mentorship of [Emily Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ebfox/), applying machine learning insights to healthcare.

To start off 2019, I'll be traveling to India to engage in humanistic co-deign and perform fieldwork exploring how computation can aid people living with disabilities in regions with less accommodating infrastructure than in the United States. My love for assistive technology has grown over the past year. Last summer, I worked on a [Seeing AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/seeing-ai), a Microsoft Research spinoff; I enjoyed the experience immensely, and after researching at the [Sinha Lab](http://web.mit.edu/sinhalab/) where I investigated habituation profiles across a range of sensory modalities in autism, took up a related side project. I've always wanted to work on technologies to improve people's lives, and hope to one day work at the intersection of machine learning and accessibility.

A link to my resume can be found [here](../resume.pdf).
